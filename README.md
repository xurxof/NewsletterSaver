NewsletterSaver
===============

NewsletterSaver is a mail dumper for converter selected mails in local html files. The intend was save mail newsletters to Dropbox public folder. With [ifttt](www.iftttt.com) I send new Dropbox elements to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) for revisions. 

You can configure the program with a config file. You must indicate the file path to the config file.

  	newsletteraaver.exe c:\tmp\config.cfg

You can use NLog.config file to config log output. See [NLog] (nlog-project.org/) for further information.

If you want automatic execution, use Windows's task scheculer or similar.
